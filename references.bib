@article{Lovelock:1969wm,
	abstract = {The Euler-Lagrange equations corresponding to a Lagrange density which is a function of gij and its first two derivatives are investigated. In general these equations will be of fourth order in gij. Necessary and sufficient conditions for these Euler-Lagrange equations to be of second order are obtained and it is shown that in a four-dimensional space the Einstein field equations (with cosmological term) are the only permissible second order Euler-Lagrange equations. This result is false in a space of higher dimension. Furthermore, the only permissible third order equation in the four-dimensional case is exhibited.},

@article{Lovelock1971,
	abstract = {The Einstein tensor Gij is symmetric, divergence free, and a concomitant of the metric tensor gab together with its first two derivatives. In this paper all tensors of valency two with these properties are displayed explicitly. The number of independent tensors of this type depends crucially on the dimension of the space, and, in the four dimensional case, the only tensors with these properties are the metric and the Einstein tensors.},
